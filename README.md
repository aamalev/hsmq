## Message life cycle

Message contains:

    - data
    - headers
    - topic

After publication, messages are filtered by topic.
If the topic satisfies the condition, the message is saved in the queue.

## Queues

### InMemory

```toml
[[queues]]
type = "InMemory"
name = "b"
limit = 99  # oldest messages will be drop with metric label "drop-limit"
ack_timeout = 1  # in seconds, or use { m = 3 } to specify 3 minutes
topics = [
    "b.a",  # all messages with topic "b.a" will be kept to queue "b"
]
```


## Auth

### JWT

Your secrets must be kept to config:

```toml
[auth.jwt]
secrets = [
    "inline secret",
    { env = "JWT_SECRET" },  # secret from environment variable
    { name = "old_secret_2", env = "OLD_JWT_2" },  # name for metrics
    { name = "old_secret_1", env = "OLD_JWT_1", disable = true },
]
```

You must specify a header in each request:

    authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}

Required claims with token:

* exp - deadline unix timestamp
* sub - username


### Tokens

Your tokens must be kept to config for each user:

```toml
[users.my_username]
tokens = [
    "inline personal token",
    { env = "TOKEN" },  # token from environment variable
    { env = "TOKEN_1", disable = true },
]
```

You must specify a header in each request:

    authorization: Bearer {token}
